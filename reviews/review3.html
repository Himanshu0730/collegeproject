      <h1>FIFA 23</h1>
      <img src="../assets/images/fifa23.jpg" alt="Game Poster">
      <p>
        FIFA 23, the latest installment of EA's football simulation game, arrives amidst a turbulent time for the franchise. After a contentious split with its licensor, FIFA is undergoing a name change to EA Sports FC next year. However, despite this transition, FIFA 23 maintains the familiar gameplay and frustrations that fans have come to expect over the years.<br>
        While introducing some tactical and visual enhancements, FIFA 23 ultimately sticks to its established gameplay formula. The game's evolution feels both supported and overshadowed by its imminent conclusion, as the football gaming genre faces uncertain times.

        <h2 align="left-side">About FIFA 22</h2>
        <p>FIFA 22 heralds the next generation of virtual football, and while it does not reinvent the ball, the attacking and defending gameplay gains moment-to-moment fluidity. Goalkeeping blunders and visual inconsistencies aside, this year’s FIFA is still one of the most nuanced and enjoyable multiplayer sports games on the market, and new additions across Career Mode and Volta Football have made FIFA’s major modes more fun to play. Microtransactions still loom large, but small iterative changes and the horsepower of new-gen consoles combine to make FIFA 22 feel like a worthwhile upgrade without needing anything revolutionary or terribly exciting from EA’s side. – Jordan Oloman, September 27, 2021

      <p>FIFA 23 is a bombastic swan song for the series (under its current name, at least) with a welcome focus on theatrical flair. FUT Moments, action replays and viral-friendly gameplay revisions like Power Shots make it a more considered, memorable game of simulated football with intentional defending and plenty of drama and goals. But EA's Spartan approach to the modes that don't make money ensures FIFA 23 is an all-too-familiar beast to previous years, and Ultimate Team’s offensive focus on microtransactions continues to take much of the fun out of it.<br>

      Theatrical additions to gameplay, like the ferocious Power Shots, ensure that the FIFA name goes out with a bang rather than a whimper. Holding the bumpers and pressing shoot turns your striker into a raid boss with an interruptible attack, the camera pulling focus as they leather the ball, sending bootstrap shockwaves booming through the PS5’s controller speaker. If you get the angle wrong, FIFA 23’s newly improved acrobatic goalkeepers might be able to stop it with their individually simulated fingers, which have saved my bacon on a few occasions.</p>
