      <p>
        The outstanding remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 in 2019 and 2020 made it seem likely that Capcom would do an equally impressive job with Resident Evil 4. However, when I started playing this 2023 remake of the iconic 2005 action-horror game, I was taken aback by how it surpassed my expectations. The game kept me on the edge of my seat for a thrilling and intense 16-hour experience. The revamped campaign surpasses the original in nearly every aspect. The eerie Spanish countryside setting is even more menacing, the pacing is impeccable with no wasted moments, and the modernized controls truly enhance the game's dynamic shooting mechanics. After waiting 18 years for a game to captivate me like Resident Evil 4 did, it turns out that all I needed was another Resident Evil 4.

        Resident Evil 4, the original game, holds a significant place in Capcom's renowned survival-horror series and is widely known and respected. However, considering its release during a time when we believed Episode III would be the final Star Wars film and iPhones didn't exist, it's necessary to provide some context. Back then, it was a groundbreaking move for the Resident Evil franchise to shift from fixed-camera perspectives to an innovative over-the-shoulder viewpoint. This new perspective brought players uncomfortably close to the gore and emphasized reflexes and precise aiming. As a result, Resident Evil 4 became an unmatched action-horror masterpiece. Its impact can be seen in numerous other third-person classics such as Gears of War, Dead Space, and The Last of Us. Now, its original essence has been extracted, recreated, and integrated into a cutting-edge game, transforming it into a breathtaking and incredibly intimidating new experience.

      <h2>Resident Evil 4 (2005)</h2>
      <p>Our review of Resident Evil 4 (2005) highlights how Capcom successfully elevated the franchise to new heights. The game excelled in emphasizing the "survival" aspect of survival horror, keeping players constantly on the run for their lives. The intelligent villagers posed a greater threat than typical zombies, displaying teamwork, evading bullets, and other surprising behaviors. The boss fights were particularly impressive and delivered unexpected brilliance. The game's graphics were top-notch, and the eerie audio further intensified the fear factor, especially on Nintendo's console. The introduction of a new camera and action systems, along with Leon's excellent analog targeting function, transformed the survival horror experience completely. Resident Evil 4 surpassed its predecessors, offering a non-stop thrill that kept players engaged for over 20 hours. Matt Casamassina's review awarded the game a score of 9.8 out of 10, reflecting its exceptional quality.
