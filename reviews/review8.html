      <h2>Outlast trials</h2>

      <p>
        In-keeping with previous entries in the series, The Outlast Trials does a fantastic job at setting up the context for this descent into violent masochism. We take the role of a random person who has enlisted into a program, one which promises we “deserve to be here” to have us be “reborn” through the trials of… crazed danger and obedience.
        <br>
       Everything that you encounter takes place in a facility that can best be described as One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest had horrendous relations with Saw and out popped this monstrosity. From the hub world being an asylum complete with your own individual cell, to the viewing posts and glass observation rooms – you’ll regularly see on display throughout your trials, the game perfectly captures an eerie, uncomfortable aura.
        <br>
        Scientists are constantly watching your every move. Your actions during trials are graded on performance and you must earn your way to freedom by completing one harrowing task after another. Aside from an interesting opening salvo, the rest of the story is pieced together via lore documents you can find in trials. It can feel a bit piecemeal as a result, but picking apart the wider lore and story will be something I can foresee a lot of people having fun with.
        <br>
         It makes sense that in a more cooperative style game, there’s going to be much less personal focus on you and your character. I certainly missed the more personal touch of the previous Outlast entries’ stories, as you’re just another haphazardly created NPC in amongst a sea of other likeminded survivors. Even so, The Outlast Trials shows there’s some interesting story lurking somewhere in the bloodstained shadows.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to erase your past and experience your “rebirth”, you’ll need to embark on and survive The Outlast Trials’ multiple programs. After customising your character, you’ll be able to select from up to 3 programs – each with unique missions and objectives to complete. Once you’ve survived each initial level, you’ll unlock sub-levels and versions with difficulty modifiers to try your hand at.
        <br>
         The majority of programs fall into typical tropes of the horror genre almost immediately. Whether you’re in the Police Station, Orphanage or Circus, you’ll be tip-toeing around, avoiding enemy detection, using distractions and running away or hiding. The latter of which is where 80% of your playtime will actually be, especially as a solo player.
         <br>
         Objectives boil down to collecting keys to unlock doors, pushing X thing (a snitch for execution, a doll ride to destruction, etc), finding the right object for whatever, that kind of thing. The lack of originality in tasks was actually quite demotivating almost immediately, as The Outlast Trials had the opportunity to go for more unique setups with its co-op focus, but alas, no such luck.
